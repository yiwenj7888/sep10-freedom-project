### My findings 

---
Managing to keep your business on top is one of the biggest challenges that people face. One area that I noticed that businesses were facing was dealing with finance, which includes cash flow, budgeting, financial planning, and more. The world is now more advanced than ever before, using technology to handle these struggles can take off some weight. I’ve done some research and discovered many tools that businesses use to help solve their financial challenges.
#### Software

---
Software helps handle most of the calculations and data management part. Like apps that help with financial operations. For example an app like Xero, ranked number one in the article, [The 5 best apps for business finance](https://gocardless.com/en-us/guides/posts/best-apps-for-business-finance/), highlights the main features that help businesses manage their finances more efficiently.

Key Features:

* Inventory management – keep track of what’s in stock and what’s selling out
* Bank transactions – connect your bank account to the Xero app
* Pay bills – store your bills, pay them on time, or schedule early payments

Another app that helps businesses is Helm, ranked number one, in the article, [THE 10 BEST CASH FLOW APPS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES](https://takethehelm.app/blog/the-10-best-cash-flow-apps-for-small-businesses/), lets you see your future cash position in real-time, so you can make confident business decisions without wasting hours in spreadsheets, which helps with managing budgets, optimizing cash flow, and the overall financial health.

#### Hardware

---
Hardware is the what supports the software, ensuring that businesses have an infrastructure for software to run and work. I have discovered an article, [Top 5 Essential Computer Hardware You Should Have for Your Business](https://www.infotank.com/blog/top-5-essential-computer-hardware-you-should-have-for-your-business),which is about hardware components and talks about the important hardware for people to succeed in business. It ranks the hardware as most to least important. 

* Reliable Networking Components:
To ensure smooth communication and data transfer, invest in reliable networking components like routers, switches, and modems.
* Robust Backup and Storage Solutions:
To ensure smooth communication and data transfer, invest in reliable networking components like routers, switches, and modems.
* Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) Systems: 
Power fluctuations and outages can wreak havoc on your business operations, making uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems an essential piece of computer hardware. By providing backup power during outages or fluctuations, UPS systems protect your hardware investments and prevent data loss.

Another article that I found about hardware, [5 Considerations When Choosing Hardware for your Business](https://www.sba.gov/blog/5-considerations-when-choosing-hardware-your-business), talks about the components of a good hardware for business and describes a specific set of features for it. There are many essential features that businesses use regularly. Each product will likely have different options available. So business has to make sure that the list and the product’s features are compatible.

* Speed and performance:
The CPU is responsible for the speed and performance of the device. The more processing power available, the faster your computer or hardware device can work. Higher processing power also allows your device to complete more complicated tasks and handle larger workloads.
* Storage:
Storage and memory impacts a ton of different hardware products, from computers to thumb drives, the amount of information that a device can store for you to access and use. You need storage for everything from basic documents and photos to complicated programs and applications.


### How I found it

---
For my research on how businesses manage financial struggles using software and hardware, I started by a simple search. My first search was broad, as I wasn’t that sure of what specific software or hardware that businesses were using to solve their financial challenges. I typed “business software” into Google. This gave me a general overview of some software information but it was lacking specific information. I realized that I needed to narrow my search to focus on specific challenges businesses face for finance, such as cash flow, budgeting, and financial planning. I know that apps are related to software so I refined my search with specific terms like “business finance apps for cash flow.” This gave me better results for what I was looking for and relevant to my topic. 

### Engineering Design Process

---
I am currently still in the initial stages of the engineering design process, where I am researching software and hardware that businesses use for their financial struggles. My next step is to analyze the concrete example of a similar, existing product, noting each of its key features. And use what I research to evaluate and come up with the best ideas I can to develop a solution.

### Skills

---
Through my research on business solutions for financial struggles, I gained several important skills, particularly in how to Google effectively to find information. At the beginning of my research, I made the mistake of using broad terms to search like “business software.” While it did give me some information about the general overview of business and software, it did not give me specific information I wanted. I learned how important it was to specify and narrow down to the small details so that I can get better results for what I was looking for. Another skill I learned was evaluating search results better. Not all websites are trustworthy or useful, so I developed a better eye for looking out for signs of untrustworthy sources. For example, I noticed that some websites are older than others which was important for identifying relevant information as often newer websites have better and reliable information.
