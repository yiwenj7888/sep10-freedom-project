### Choosing a topic

---
The topic that I have decided on was business because I was interested in the aspect of the skills that the business provides. I plan on pursuing a business career after college and so I wanted to do more research on it to be more prepared. Some backup ideas that I considered were cooking and music as these topics were what I do with my free time. These topics hold a sentimental meaning for me but I ended up choosing business for it was a future goal that I’ll be focusing on. Business offers various key skills such as critical thinking, communication, leadership, and time management, these are not only applicable in business but also valuable in everyday life. In the article, [12 Business skills you need to master](https://www.business.com/articles/12-business-skills-you-need-to-master/), it highlights essential skills for success in the business world.

With business you develop a diverse set of skills that can help you across the workforce or just everyday life.
