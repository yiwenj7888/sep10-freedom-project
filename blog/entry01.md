### Choosing a topic

The topic that I have decided on was business because I was interested in the aspect of the skills that the business provides. I plan on pursuing a business career after college and so I wanted to do more research on it to be more prepared. Some backup ideas that I considered were cooking and music as these topics were what I do with my free time. These topics hold a sentimental meaning for me but I ended up choosing business for it was a future goal that I’ll be focusing on. Business offers various key skills such as critical thinking, communication, leadership, and time management, these are not only applicable in business but also valuable in everyday life. In the article, [12 Business skills you need to master](https://www.business.com/articles/12-business-skills-you-need-to-master/), it highlights essential skills for success in the business world. Even if you don’t master them, you essentially still have the basics of it which can serve you well throughout your career. With business you develop a diverse set of skills that can help you across the workforce or just everyday life.

With these skills it opens the door to more opportunities for successful careers as learning business skills helps you to face challenges where you’ll know how to deal with it effectively. 
### Engineering Design Process

I am currently in the initial stage of the engineering design process, where I will try to find struggles that business owners face. I’m inspired to use advanced technology to solve problems in the business world. My plans for the future is to design a website to help new business owners with financial challenges. As I identified the struggles that may arise as a business grows and evolves. One of them being new businesses struggling to manage finances. This includes understanding cash flow, budgeting, financial planning, and more. My website will try to focus on these problems and build tools to help manage the financial struggles.
### Skills

Some skills I have are good time management and organizational skills. I have the ability to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance. I create to-do lists for my assignments. This helps me focus on what needs immediate attention and which assignments I can focus on later. I also use digital calendars and note-taking apps to keep track and organize what I need to remember for each day. I make sure that important dates like assessments and projects are highlighted in my calendar so I know how to plan my schedule for that day.
