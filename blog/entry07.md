### Context

After weeks of researching, brainstorming, and designing, I finally had the opportunity to share my innovation project publicly, first through the Expo elevator pitch, and then more formally with the in-class presentation. These experiences not only helped me grow as a communicator, but also gave me a better understanding of how far I’ve come with applying the Engineering Design Process (EDP) and building professional skills.

#### Takeaways from Giving My Expo Elevator Pitch
At the Expo, I had to quickly explain my innovation project in a short, engaging way. This was challenging at first because I’m used to writing or designing, not speaking on the spot. I realized that knowing my topic wasn’t enough and I had to grab attention, speak with confidence, and explain my idea clearly in under a minute.

What I learned:
* I need to make my message simple and memorable.
* Real statistics help capture attention (like the 34.8 million small businesses stat I used).
* Speaking naturally (rather than reading) makes me come across as more confident.
* Practicing my pitch out loud made a big difference.

[Elevator Pitch:](https://classroom.google.com/c/NzQ3MjM0MzQwMzg2/sa/Nzg1MTE1Njg3OTA1/details)

"Hello! Did you know that in 2024, there were about 34.8 million small businesses in the U.S., but roughly 20% fail in the first year, and by year five, half are gone? Running a small business is tough, and staying successful is even harder. That's why I created a website designed to help inform how small business owners could use technology for operations and improve their chances of success. Here, you can see current business technology that is and can be used to help small businesses improve their operations. And here you can see some future ideas I have for the future. I learned and used Animate.css for smooth animations to make navigation engaging to the users."

#### Takeaways from the In-Class Presentation
The in-class [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lDqWdwWhTL8kwpw7pFsEmsld9JAVOYsSzO4TNNZsYKc/edit?usp=sharing) gave me more time to go in-depth about my project. I used slides to organize my points, including the challenges small businesses face and the tech innovations that could help them. I felt nervous at first, but as I got into the flow, I became more comfortable explaining the purpose behind my innovations.

What I learned:
* Visuals help! Showing timelines and mockups made it easier for my audience to follow.
* Keeping an eye contact!
  * I need to improve at keeping eye contact and not relying too much on my notes.
  * I need to be more confident with looking at the audience.
* Speaking more loudly

Teacher feedback:

The feedback I received from my teacher, Mr. Mueller, was incredibly valuable and highlighted some areas where I can improve my presentation skills. One key takeaway was that my hook, the opening part of my presentation, had took too long to get to the main point. While I wanted to capture the audience's attention, I now see that a quicker, more direct approach would be more effective in drawing them in right away. Another piece of feedback was about the flow of my presentation. Mr. Mueller mentioned that it was a bit confusing to go through all the takeaways and key points before actually showing the website. In hindsight, I can see how presenting the website earlier would have given context to the rest of my slides, making them easier to understand. On the delivery side, I was advised to speak louder and make more eye contact. I realized that these small changes can make a big difference in how engaged my audience feels. Overall, the feedback helped me recognize that while the explanations were clear, my presentation structure and delivery could be improved for more impact next time. Moving forward, I plan to work on improving my opening, reordering my content for better clarity, and focusing on my speaking technique to make future presentations even stronger.

### Engineering Design Process
Right now, I’m in the later stages of the Engineering Design Process, where my focus has shifted from idea creation to refining and presenting my final product. I’ve already moved through the earlier phases, asking questions about the struggles small businesses face, imagining innovative solutions, and planning out the structure of my website and how to organize the information. I’ve created content that includes both current and future technologies that help businesses operate more efficiently, and I’ve built the website using tools like Animate.css to improve the user experience. At this stage, I’m polishing the project based on feedback I received during my Expo pitch and class presentation. I’m making sure the website flows smoothly, the information is clear, and that all the sections are professional and organized. My next steps are to finalize the written content, double-check for any errors, and make sure the visuals and design elements support the message I want to deliver. This part of the EDP is all about improving and delivering, turning a good idea into a finished, impactful product.

### Skills
This whole process helped me build key skills that I’ll use in college and beyond:
* Creative thinking: Brainstorming innovations that don’t yet exist but could solve real problems.
* Communication: Explaining my ideas clearly in both quick and long-form formats.
* Professionalism: Learning to present myself and my ideas seriously and respectfully.
* Tech skills: Practicing web development and learning small tools like Animate.css to improve user experience.
* Feedback use: Listening to suggestions and using them to improve my presentation and website.
