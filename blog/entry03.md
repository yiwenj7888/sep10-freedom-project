### Context

For part B, I started to think of ideas for innovations that could help businesses overcome their struggles. So, I’ve been thinking about common challenges businesses face, especially smaller ones or startups that might not have the resources for solutions. Businesses often struggle with customer engagement, workflow efficiency, and data management. From there, I made a list of possible solutions that help businesses, keeping in mind that my innovations should be able to address the potential problem and solutions.

#### Productivity Glasses 
* Uses: It enhances productivity by having task management and helps organize the employees work life. 
* Issues it solves: Employees productivity decreases in a multitasking environment where they often have multiple tasks like files needing to be written, emails and meetings, having to handle and work on multiple tasks to finish the deadline which leads to reduced focus and motivation. The glasses will help organize the tasks through deadlines and notify the employer’s productivity while giving advice through the glasses.
* It’s importance: These glasses will help employers to stay organized, reduce distractions, and increase their workflow efficiency.

#### Customer’s Emotional Data Analytic
* Uses: It’s a real time tool that analyzes customer behavior across data it has seen through social media, email, surveys, etc. It provides businesses with insights of customer’s emotional engagement towards the product. 
* Issues it solves: Understanding customer’s emotions towards a product can be challenging for businesses, especially with huge amounts of feedback coming in. Often businesses only discover the issues after they escalate, affecting the reputation and trust of customers. 
* It’s importance: While emotion analysis tools may exist, none offer real time insights with enough guarantee to help businesses adjust their strategies immediately.

#### Schedule Optimizer 
* Uses: A software tool that combines employee preferences and their available time to automatically generate optimal work schedules. It can adjust to accommodate changes in demand.
* Issues it solves: Reducing the need for last minute staffing adjustments while also improving employees' work life stressors. It increases employee satisfaction that helps businesses create flexible yet efficient schedules.
* It’s importance: Often employees stress about having to follow the strict demand for schedules arranged for them. This creates even more stress when employers can’t make it due to issues they are facing in their private lives or running late which makes businesses needing staffing replacements quickly.

#### Marketing Strategy Generator
* Uses: A tool that creates personalized marketing strategies based on customer data and market trends. It would generate campaigns while also optimizing them based on the performance data. 
* Issues it solves: Many businesses, especially small businesses struggle with developing and implementing effective marketing strategies. This will help improve their marketing and continuously improve with data collecting every time. 
* It’s importance: Marketing strategies often rely on intuition or testing strategies that could work. Marketing strategy generator helps businesses maximize and better target customers while also adopting in real time with data.

#### Management System
* Uses: A management system that predicts and manages business crises by analyzing data and recommending advice continuously.
* Issues it solves: Many businesses might not be prepared for the sudden changes in the market. Reacting after the issue will be costly and will damage the business severely.
* It’s importance:  While there might be some tools that can foresee the issues, there isn’t one that guides businesses through various types of issues that can happen.

### Finalizing 
After brainstorming my ideas, the next step was finalizing all the content so that the website could be ready for designing. This process involves refining written content, organizing it into clear sections, and ensuring that all aspects of the website are aligned with the target audience. The first step was to ensure that the website’s message was clear. I needed to write an introduction that introduces the topic about businesses and their struggles. Also explaining the current and past creations that was invented while the main focus will be what the next innovations were, how they solved the problem for businesses.

### Engineering Design Process
I am currently still in the initial stages of the engineering design process, where I am brainstorming ideas for solutions to help businesses with their needs. This is where I get to think creatively and explore all the possibilities for innovations that could help businesses overcome their struggles. At the same time, I know I need to focus on finding solutions that are not only creative but also impactful. My next step is to develop and prototype the solution, creating a website for showcasing the innovation. The website will serve as the platform for presenting my ideas and innovations to businesses, explaining how they work, and their uses to help businesses with their difficulties.

### Skills
Throughout the process of brainstorming innovations and refining the content for the website, I acquired several key skills that were essential not only for this project but also my overall growth. These skills include creative thinking and problem solving skills. 
Brainstorming ideas for innovations required a lot of creative thinking to identify real world problems that businesses faced and design solutions that were able to solve their problems. I learned how to approach a problem from multiple angles, identify opportunities for innovation, and refine my ideas throughout the process. This skill will be of value in any field that requires problem solving. The ability to think creatively and adapt solutions to real world challenges is a critical skill needed for my future career, business.
