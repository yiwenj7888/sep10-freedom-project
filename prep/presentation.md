# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* "Imagine a business that has the power to adapt to any technological change, how would it look?"
  * This hooks the audience into thinking about how technology shapes the business world.
    
## Product
* Demo: I’ll show you a demo of the website I created, which highlights the timeline of business technologies from past to future.
   * What does it show? The impact of technology on businesses over the years.
   * The interface is user-friendly and interactive, using Bootstrap and Animate.css.
     
## Process
* Flowchart: I’ll walk you through the planning process of this project.
    * The key steps include:
        * 1    Research on business technologies.
        * 2    Designing the user interface with Bootstrap.
        * 3    Enhancing the user experience with Animate.css for smooth animations.
    * Code snippets: A glimpse of the MVP, such as the HTML structure and how I used Bootstrap to create responsive designs, and the addion of Animate.css for animation of my texts. 

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways:
    * 1    Less is more: I focused on simplicity in design and functionality.
    * 2    Expect the unexpected: I faced challenges, such as handling responsive layouts, but adapted using Bootstrap.
    * 3    Determination is key: Even with challenges, I was able to create an interactive and informative timeline using Bootstrap and Animate.css.
* Last line/Final thought: Technology shapes the future of business, and innovation can lead to endless opportunities.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
